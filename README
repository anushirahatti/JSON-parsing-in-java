JSON PARSING In JAVA USING WEB SERVICE

Hello!

The "JsonParsingExample.java" contains code in JAVA to parse the JSON data.
In this example, we call a web service by hitting URL and parse the data we get.
The JSON data we receive is directly used to parse. So, the data is not stored in hard drive. 
Thus, the parsing process becomes fast !

NOTE:- Add "json-simple-1.1.1.jar" to your library. 

Guys, I hope this code will be useful for you !
